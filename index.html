    <h1>What is Category 5?</h1>
    <p>Category 5 is the spirit programming board that works closely with Athletics to host events that promote school spirit and love for our Alma Mater. It also powers The Eye, the official student section of Hurricanes athletics. Category 5's Council builds and maintains school spirit and traditions through various campus events while creating a welcoming atmosphere for all students to show their Hurricane pride. The organization is divided into five committees.</p>
