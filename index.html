    <h1>What is Category 5?</h1>
    <p><strong><em>Category 5</em></strong> is the spirit programming board that works closely with Athletics to host events that promote school spirit<br>and love for our Alma Mater. It also powers <em>The Eye</em>, the official student section of <a href="https://miamihurricanes.com/">Hurricanes athletics</a>. Category 5's<br>Council builds and maintains school spirit and traditions through various campus events while creating a welcoming atmosphere<br>for all students to show their Hurricane pride. The organization is an agency of the University of Miami Student Government and<br><a href="https://saso.studentaffairs.miami.edu/">Student Activities and Student Organizations</a> department. It is divided into five committees.    </p>
